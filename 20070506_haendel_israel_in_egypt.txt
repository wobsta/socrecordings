CD 1
1 Symphony
2 Now there arose a new king over Egypt
3 And the children of Israel sighed
4 Then sent He Moses
5 They loathed to drink of the river
6 Their land brought forth frogs
7 He spake the word
8 He gave them hailstones for rain
9 He sent a thick darkness over all the land
10 He smote all the first-born of Egypt
11 But as for His people
12 Egypt was glad when they departed
13 He rebuked the Red Sea
14 He led them through the deep
15 But the waters overwhelmed their enemies
16 And Israel saw that great work
17 And believed the Lord and His servant Moses

1 Moses and the children of Israel
2 I will sing unto the Lord
3 The Lord is my strength and my song
4 He is my god
5 And I will exalt Him
6 The Lord is a man of war
7 The depths have covered them
8 Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious
9 And in the greatness of Thy nostrils
10 Thou sentest forth Thy wrath
11 And with the blast of Thy nostrils
12 The enemy said
13 Thou didst blow with the wind
14 Who is like unto Thee
15 The earth swallowed them
16 Thou in Thy mercy
17 The people shall hear
18 Thou shalt bring them in
19 The Lord shall reign for ever and ever
20 For the horse of Pharaoh
21 The Lord shall reign for ever and ever
22 And Miriam the prophetess
23 Sing ye to the Lord
