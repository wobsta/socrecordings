2 Comfort ye
3 Ev'ry valley
4 And the glory of the Lord
5 Thus saith the Lord
6 But who may abide
7 And He shall purify
8 Behold, a virgin shall conceive
9 O thou that tellest
10 For behold, darkness shall cover the earth
11 The people that walked in darkness
12 For unto us a child is born
13 Pifa
14 There were shepherds
15 And lo, the angel of the Lord
16 And the angel said unto them
17 And suddenly
18 Glory to God in the highest
19 Rejoice greatly
20 Then shall the eyes of the blind be open'd
21 He shall feed His flock
22 His yoke is easy
23 Behold the Lamb of God
24 He was despised
25 Surely
26 And with His stripes
27 All we, like sheep
CD 2
1 All they that see Him
2 He trusted in God
3 Thy rebuke hath broken His heart
4 Behold, and see
5 He was cut off
6 But Thou didst not leave
7 Lift up your heads
8 Let all the angels
9 Thou art gone up on high
10 The Lord gave the word
11 How beautiful are the feet
12 Why do the nations
13 Let us break their bonds
14 Thou shalt break them
15 Hallelujah!
16 I know that my Redeemer liveth
17 Since by man
18 Behold, I tell you a mystery
19 The trumpet shall sound
20 Then shall be brought to pass
21 O death, where is thy sting
22 But thanks be to God
23 If God be for us
24 Worthy is the Lamb
